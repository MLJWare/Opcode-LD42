[[
Time to remove the
training wheels:
Here are all the
remaining opcodes.]];
[[
The green opcode allows
you to set a variable
(a value you can use
later).]];
[[
The variables are
letters from A to H,
and can be set either
to a number, or to
another variable.]];
[[
The new red opcode
allows you to move the
robot by a specific
amount.]];
[[
It can take either a
number from 1 to 9, or
a variable from A to H.]];
[[
The new blue opcode
allows you to do a
conditional jump.]];
[[
If the variable in the
left field is not
greater than 0, it acts
as a jump; otherwise it
does nothing.]];
[[
Finally, the yellow
opcodes allows you to
change the value of a
variable.]];
[[
Using these, you can
add, subtract, multiply,
and divide any variable
by either a number, or
another variable.]];
[[
Good luck, you won't
hear from me agin until
the final level.
Take care!]]
